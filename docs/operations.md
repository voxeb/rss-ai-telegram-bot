# Operations

This runbook describes existing behavior and how to inspect it. Repository baseline: [6174929](https://github.com/voxeb/rss-ai-telegram-bot/commit/61749299e7f49573fa36bcf6f56dd0025a2aaf8b), reviewed on 2026-10-25. See [architecture](architecture.md) for limitations and open decisions.

## Deployment evidence

The maintainer supplied the following `gcloud run jobs describe` output during queue troubleshooting. This is an **operator-provided snapshot**, not an independent inspection of the current deployment.

| Setting | Reported value |
|---|---|
| Project / region / Job | `register-news` / `europe-west1` / `register-news` |
| Task count / task retries / timeout | `1` / `0` / `180s` |
| Runtime service account | `register-bot@register-news.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| Image repository | `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/register-news/cloud-run-source-deploy/register-news` |
| Image digest | `sha256:a616c921dbb2892b136f07eb1f6f873ba87867166214154ffcc9a8fb28718a0d` |

The source commit for that digest, current Scheduler configuration, recent execution outcomes, alert coverage, actual Gemini tier/quotas, and cloud spending are **not verified**. Do not label this image as containing PR #1 without build/deployment evidence. Track these checks in [baseline Issue #2](https://github.com/voxeb/rss-ai-telegram-bot/issues/2) and keep it open until they are resolved.

After an approved deployment, record its date, source commit, immutable image digest, approving PR, and first checked execution in this section. No deployment was performed to create this document.

## Inspect before changing anything

Use the actual project and region. These examples show the reported deployment; fork operators should substitute their own values.

```bash
PROJECT_ID="register-news"
REGION="europe-west1"
JOB="register-news"
```

Read only the relevant Job fields; do not export secret values:

```bash
gcloud run jobs describe "$JOB" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" --region="$REGION" \
  --format="yaml(spec.template.spec.taskCount,spec.template.spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName,spec.template.spec.template.spec.maxRetries,spec.template.spec.template.spec.timeoutSeconds,spec.template.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image)"

gcloud run jobs executions list \
  --job="$JOB" --project="$PROJECT_ID" --region="$REGION" --limit=10
```

Discover the Scheduler Job before assuming its name or creating another one. Set `SCHEDULER_REGION` to the location actually used; it need not match the Cloud Run region.

```bash
SCHEDULER_REGION="YOUR_SCHEDULER_REGION"
gcloud scheduler jobs list \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" --location="$SCHEDULER_REGION" \
  --format="table(name,schedule,timeZone,state,httpTarget.uri)"
```

Inspect the selected trigger's identity, target, authorization, schedule, and state in the console. The documented schedule is `*/5 * * * *`; it has not been verified against the live trigger. Match the image digest to Cloud Build/deployment records. A passing GitHub check is not deployment evidence.

## First installation and deployment

Use an authenticated Google Cloud CLI with permission to manage the intended resources. For a new installation, enable Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Cloud Scheduler, Firestore, and Secret Manager APIs; use a Firestore Native `(default)` database. Create `telegram-bot-token` and `gemini-api-key` secrets without committing their values. The runtime `register-bot` service account needs `roles/datastore.user` and `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on those two secrets. Use a separate Scheduler identity with permission to invoke the Job.

For an existing deployment, inspect its configuration and source checkout first. Production configuration changes and deployment require explicit maintainer approval. Capture the current image digest and relevant non-secret settings for rollback.

The following command is the installation template; replace all project-specific values and run it from the approved source revision. Its `--set-*` flags replace configuration and must not be copied blindly over an existing Job.

```bash
PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
REGION="europe-west1"
CHANNEL="@YOUR_CHANNEL"
JOB="register-news"

gcloud run jobs deploy "$JOB" \
  --source . --project="$PROJECT_ID" --region="$REGION" \
  --service-account="register-bot@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --tasks=1 --max-retries=0 --task-timeout=180s \
  --memory=512Mi --cpu=1 \
  --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${PROJECT_ID},TELEGRAM_CHANNEL=${CHANNEL}" \
  --set-secrets="TELEGRAM_TOKEN=telegram-bot-token:latest,GEMINI_API_KEY=gemini-api-key:latest"
```

Only on a new installation, before enabling the Scheduler, run the Job once to seed current feed items without publishing them:

```bash
gcloud run jobs execute "$JOB" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" --region="$REGION" --wait
```

On an initialized installation the same command performs real publication. Never delete `settings/feed` or publication records to repeat setup: seeding can mark current articles skipped and damage publication history. After initialization, configure the Scheduler to invoke the Job every five minutes. Keep `TEST_MODE` out of its persistent configuration.

## Testing and monitoring

Use the local credential-free tests for development. A one-off integration test below sends a **real Telegram message** and does not update publication history; use an approved destination and execution. It overrides the environment for this execution only.

```bash
gcloud run jobs execute "$JOB" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" --region="$REGION" \
  --update-env-vars=TEST_MODE=true --wait
```

Inspect execution logs in Cloud Logging using this filter:

```text
resource.type="cloud_run_job"
resource.labels.job_name="register-news"
resource.labels.location="europe-west1"
```

Example result: `Published 2 new articles (attempted 3, failed 1)`.

| Result | Meaning and follow-up |
|---|---|
| At least one attempt and no publication | Job fails. Inspect the first error, affected URLs, provider responses, and retry state. |
| Some publications and some failures | Job succeeds; individual failures still require inspection. |
| No eligible articles | Job succeeds. This can mean no new work, active leases, delayed retries, or exhausted attempts. |
| Firestore failure or cancellation | Job fails. A Telegram send may already have succeeded; inspect the channel before retrying. |

Recommended controls, **not verified as configured**: failed-execution alerts, detection of individual processing errors, and review of exhausted records. Choose alert thresholds after establishing normal feed activity; silence alone does not prove a fault. An alert on failed Jobs alone misses partial failures. Check application error messages as well as platform status; do not assume plain-text logs have structured error severity.

Transport errors can currently include the Telegram request URL and token. Redact credentials before sharing logs or attaching evidence to a public Issue. Fixing this risk is a separate task; this runbook does not claim an actual disclosure.

## Recovering an article

1. Identify the original failure from logs and the `articles/{key}` record; fix or resolve its cause first.
2. If a Telegram request had an uncertain result, or Firestore completion failed, inspect the destination channel. Delivery is not atomic with storage, and the application does not store Telegram message IDs.
3. Confirm the item remains in the current RSS feed. The existing worker will not process it after feed eviction, even if a Firestore record exists.
4. After approval for the retry and after any live claim has ended, reset only that article to `status: "retry"`, `attempts: 0`, `owner: ""`, and a Firestore timestamp in the past for `leaseUntil`. Preserve its identity and other fields. Do not reset an active worker's claim.
5. Observe the next normal execution and the channel. It may process other eligible articles as well; new articles have priority. Leave `published` and `seeded` records unchanged.

There is no implemented replay command for items outside the feed. Global quota/service errors currently consume article attempts; do not repeatedly reset many records without resolving the common cause. Retry and stale-news policy remain open decisions.

## Rollback

After explicit approval, pause the known Scheduler trigger if needed and account for any already-running executions. Select a previously recorded, known-good immutable image; check its compatibility with the existing Firestore states. Do not clear Firestore to roll back code.

```bash
PREVIOUS_IMAGE="YOUR_PREVIOUS_IMAGE_URI@sha256:YOUR_RECORDED_DIGEST"
gcloud run jobs update "$JOB" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" --region="$REGION" \
  --image="$PREVIOUS_IMAGE"
```

Updating the image does not undo earlier messages or state writes, restore changed Job settings, or pin secrets referenced as `latest`. Restore any changed non-secret settings separately from the recorded baseline. Check one approved execution and its channel effects before resuming the normal schedule; record the rollback and source/image mapping.

## Quotas and costs

The five-attempt run limit, five-attempt article budget, 24,000-byte article input cap, and 300-output-token request limit bound individual work, not total project spending. A retry after Telegram failure regenerates the summary. Firestore reads, builds, image storage, scheduling, logs, and Job execution can also contribute to costs.

Before choosing limits, inspect actual Gemini tier, usage and quotas in AI Studio, plus actual Google Cloud billing and existing alerts. Record a dated result and the agreed spending policy in [baseline Issue #2](https://github.com/voxeb/rss-ai-telegram-bot/issues/2); credentials do not belong in that evidence. Do not infer free operation from the deployment guide. Billing alerts are notifications, not an automatic spending stop.

Checked on 2026-10-25: Google lists `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` and a free tier; actual project access and limits remain unverified. Use the current official sources when changing the model or budget:
